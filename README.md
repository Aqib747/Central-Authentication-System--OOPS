# Central-Authentication-System--OOPS

Simple central authentication and authorization system.
The entire system will be placed in one module, and other code will be able to query
that module object for authentication and authorization purposes
I should admit,from the start, that i am not a security experts, and that the system  designined may be full of security holes. 
Our purpose is to study exceptions, not to secure a
may be full of security holes. Our purpose is to study exceptions, not to secure a
system. It will be sufficient, however, for a basic login and permission system that
other code can interact with. Later, if that other code needs to be made more secure,
we can have a security or cryptography expert review or rewrite our module,





Authentication is the process of ensuring a user is really the person they say they
are. We'll follow the lead of common web systems today, which use a username
and private password combination. Other methods of authentication include voice
recognition, fingerprint or retinal scanners, and identification cards.
